0x1A. C - Hash tables

For effective data retrieval, hash tables are a common data structure in
computer science and programming. Data is kept in key-value pairs in a hash
table, and a hash function is used to map keys to specific positions in the table
so that values associated with a given key may be rapidly retrieved.
