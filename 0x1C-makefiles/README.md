A Makefile is a unique file used in software development that contains instructions 
on how to construct and oversee a project. Though it can also be used with other 
languages and build processes, it is most frequently linked to the C programming 
language. Makefiles are commonly used to automate the build process, enabling you
 to construct executables or libraries, link object files, and compile source code
 with a single command.
