0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

## A dynamic library is a programming idea where shared libraries with certain functionality are only launched during program execution, hence reducing overall program size and facilitating greater application performance for decreased memory usage. Specific functionalities are typically divided into separate modules in software systems to enable load-on-demand.
