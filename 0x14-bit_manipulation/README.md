0x14. C - Bit manipulation

##The act of algorithmically altering bits or other smaller chunks of data is known as bit manipulation. C is an extremely effective bit manipulation language. Low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption methods, and optimization are all tasks that require bit manipulation in computer programming.
