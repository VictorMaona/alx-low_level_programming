##0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are frequently used to locate a certain element in a data structure, like an array, or determine whether it exists at all. Binary search and linear search are two popular search methods.

1. linear search or sequential search:
The simplest search algorithm is linear search, which performs best with small datasets.
It goes through the array element by element until a match is found or it has reached the end.
This is a basic C application for linear search:

2. Binary Search:
Although it necessitates a sorted array, binary search is more effective than linear search.
Until the target is located or the interval is empty, it periodically divides the search interval in half.
This  is a basic C binary search implementation:
